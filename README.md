# loadjsonfromAPI

##Frontend Challenge

Fetch JSON data from an API and populate a dropdown menu with options based on the results. You can use whatever libraries or frameworks you like.

If you're new to front end problems or are not sure where to start, check out the Resources section below.

This example is a common type of coding challenge whereby applicants are asked to fetch JSON data from an API and somehow update the UI or content using the retrieved data.

Checkout the jquery branch to check out a possible solution that makes use of that library. (You can consider extending this example by generating a chart based on the data returned and displaying the relevant chart when each option is selected.)
